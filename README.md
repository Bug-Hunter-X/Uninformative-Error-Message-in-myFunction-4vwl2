# Uninformative Error Message in myFunction

This repository contains a MATLAB function (`myFunction.m`) that throws an uninformative error message when a negative number is passed as input.  The improved version (`bugSolution.m`) provides a more descriptive error message to aid in debugging.

## Bug Report

The original function throws a generic error when it receives a negative input value. This makes it difficult to understand the cause of the error without examining the function's code.

## Solution

The solution improves the error message by explicitly stating the issue (negative input).  This enhancement significantly improves the debugging experience.
